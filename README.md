# Train-Scheduler

A page where users can input new trains to update a schedule table

Enter in the train name, destination, time of the first arrival in military HH:mm format, and the frequency in minutes. Click submit to add it to the table.

Requirements:

* Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
  
  * Styling and theme are completely up to you.
